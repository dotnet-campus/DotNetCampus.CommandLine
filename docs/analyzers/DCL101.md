Option long name must be PascalCase

The command-line option definition names must be PascalCase, even though you can use any kind of style in the command line environment.

## Code

```csharp
class Options
{
    [Option('d', "--walterlv-is-adobe")]
    public string? DemoOption { get; set; }
}
```

In this case, the `--walterlv-is-adobe` will be reported and be fixed to `WalterlvIsAdobe`.

## Why

the dotnetCampus.CommandLine supports a variety kinds of command-line styles. The users can type in the command line using the PowerShell style, the Bash style or the CMD style, or even the web URL style. In this case, we should know the exact words of any option names instead of unlimited strings. We choose the Pascal naming convention to help us to split an identifier into different words.
